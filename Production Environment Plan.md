### Production Environment Plan (PEP)

#### Overview

This Production Environment Plan outlines the steps required to automate the data scraping, standardization, and continuous updating processes for construction and infrastructure project data in California. The plan includes the setup of automation scripts, logging, error handling, and monitoring mechanisms to ensure reliable operation in a production environment.

---

#### Components

1. **Automation Scripts**
2. **Cron Jobs and Task Scheduler Setup**
3. **Logging and Error Handling**
4. **Monitoring and Alerts**

---

### 1. Automation Scripts

**scraper.py**

**standardize.py**

**automate.py**


### 2. Cron Jobs and Task Scheduler Setup

#### Unix-like Systems

1. **Create a Shell Script (`run_automation.sh`)**:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
python3 /path/to/automate.py > /path/to/logfile.log 2>&1
```

Make the script executable:

```sh
chmod +x /path/to/run_automation.sh
```

2. **Set Up a Cron Job**:

```sh
crontab -e
```

Add the following line to run the script daily at midnight:

```sh
0 0 * * * /path/to/run_automation.sh
```

#### Windows Systems

1. **Create a Batch File (`run_automation.bat`)**:

```bat
@echo off
python "C:\path\to\automate.py" > "C:\path\to\logfile.log" 2>&1
```

2. **Schedule a Task Using Task Scheduler**:

- Open Task Scheduler and create a new task.
- Set the trigger to run daily at your preferred time.
- Set the action to start the batch file you created.
- Configure task settings to capture errors and output.

---

### 3. Logging and Error Handling

#### Logging

- Redirect the output of the scripts to log files in both shell scripts and batch files.
- Ensure logs capture standard output and errors (`2>&1`).

#### Error Handling

- Check the return code of the scripts and log errors.

**Unix-like Systems Example**:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
python3 /path/to/automate.py > /path/to/logfile.log 2>&1
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Error occurred while running automate.py" >> /path/to/errorlog.log
fi
```

**Windows Systems Example**:

```bat
@echo off
python "C:\path\to\automate.py" > "C:\path\to\logfile.log" 2>&1
if %errorlevel% neq 0 (
  echo Error occurred while running automate.py >> "C:\path\to\errorlog.log"
)
```

---

### 4. Monitoring and Alerts

#### Unix-like Systems

- Use tools like `cronolog` for managing log files and `logrotate` for rotating logs.
- Set up email alerts for critical errors using `mail` or other email tools.

**Example**:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
python3 /path/to/automate.py > /path/to/logfile.log 2>&1
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Error occurred while running automate.py" | mail -s "Automation Script Error" your-email@example.com
fi
```

#### Windows Systems

- Use Task Scheduler's built-in monitoring tools to ensure tasks run as expected.
- Monitor the Event Viewer for task failures and alerts.
- Configure email alerts or notifications for critical errors using Task Scheduler's alerting features.

---

### Summary

This production environment plan ensures that the data scraping and standardization tasks run automatically and reliably, with proper logging, error handling, and monitoring in place. Implementing these steps will help maintain the system's integrity and ensure continuous data updates.
